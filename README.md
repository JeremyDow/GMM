# Gear Mesh Model (GMM)

The Gear Mesh Model (GMM) is a phase-coherent field interpretation of quantum behavior developed by Jeremy Dow.

## Research Dossier Overview

The Coherence Research Program is a constraint-first theoretical architecture built on variational admissibility, conservation, and positivity principles.

It consists of four completed and closed pillars:

### I. Phase–Coupled Field Framework (PCF)
A covariant, coherence-first field theory derived from the Coherence–Action Principle (CAP), unifying interference-scale dynamics, transport, and gravitational coupling.

Canonical record:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18057659

---

### II. Coherence Geometry Program (CGP)
A geometric extension of PCF in which causality, relativistic structure, and Schrödinger emergence arise from admissible coherence transport.

---

### III. Dark Sector & Gravitational Diagnostics
A constraint-first reinterpretation of dark matter and dark energy as coherence transport artifacts rather than new ontological particles.

---

### IV. Prime–Resonance Operator (PRO) Program
A completed operator framework establishing admissibility, boundedness, uniform positivity, and equivalence to classical analytic formulations.

Program anchor:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17620485

---

### Mathematical Closure

The program includes:
- Action-based conservation and threshold structure (CAP)
- Explicit positivity bounds (PRO VI–VII)
- Stability and localization proofs
- Equivalence completion (PRO VIII)

All results are publicly archived on Zenodo.

---

### Methodological Position

The framework operates under:

- Constraint–First Reasoning
- No Ontological Inflation Principle (NOIP)
- Admissibility over construction
- Diagnostics over narrative interpretation

---

This repository serves as the public gateway to the full research archive.

This repository serves as:
- A public landing page for the GMM framework
- A bridge to formal publications
- A reference hub for collaborators and researchers

## Core Framework

The professional structure of the model follows:

- **CAP** — Coherence-Action Principle  
- **PCF** — Phase-Coupled Field Framework  
- **GMM** — Gear Mesh Model (intuitive layer)
