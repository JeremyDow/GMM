# Gear Mesh Model (GMM)

The Gear Mesh Model (GMM) is a phase-coherent field interpretation of quantum behavior developed by Jeremy Dow.

This repository serves as:
- A public landing page for the GMM framework
- A bridge to formal publications
- A reference hub for collaborators and researchers

## Core Framework

The professional structure of the model follows:

- **CAP** — Coherence-Action Principle  
- **PCF** — Phase-Coupled Field Framework  
- **GMM** — Gear Mesh Model (intuitive layer)
